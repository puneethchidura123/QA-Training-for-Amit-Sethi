Selenium is not just a single tool but a suite of different softwares, each software under selenium suite is designed for a specific purpose


Selenium IDE : it is just a chrome plugin and used for record and playback

Selenium RC : 	it is advanced when compared to IDE, usining RC we could design complex test scripts using multiple programming laguages like JAVA,C#,PYTHON
