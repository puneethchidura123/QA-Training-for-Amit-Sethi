GIT - Version controlling

Using git we will be able to maintain multiple versions of a particular software very easily
In a realtime environment with git it is easy to share the project changes in files among all the team members.


Remote repo : git hub
Local repo : laptop


Git add . : it will move all the changes from local repo to staging area
Git commit -m “commit message” : it will commit all the changes moved to staging area
Git push : it will move the changes from local repo to remote repo
Git pull : it will move the changes from  remote repo to  local repo 


Java Variable.
variables are used for storing the data either temporarily or permanantly. 

x=10;
x=20;

String : stores text
note : every string value in java should be enclosed with in " " 
int : it will store whole numbers
float : it will store decimal values
char : it will store a single character
boolean : either true or false


syntax for writing variables

<data type> <variable name> = <value>;

note :  in java every statement should end with a semicolon";"


when we want to assign a value to a variable permanantly the that variable has to be declared as final.



Java Identifiers:
==================
java identifiers are nothing but the variable names.
each variable name in java must be unique.

some additional rules for java identifiers
1)identifiers names should only contain letters, digits,underscore and dollar sign only
2)identifiers name should begin with a letter
3) Spaces are not allowed
4)there are 53 reserved words in java, these reserved words cannot be used as identifiers



Java Data Types
===============

data type in java will specify the type of data a variable stores/holds

in java there are 8 primitive data types

whole numbers :

byte  : 1 byte - -127 to 126
short : 2 bytes
int : 4 bytes
long : 8 bytes 

decimals :


float : 4 bytes
double : 8 bytes

single alphabets ::

char


true or false :: 

boolean



non primitive data types ::

String is a non primitive data type 




Type Casting :  
=============


type casting is assigning a value of one data type to another

there are two types of type casting

narrowing ::  assigning a larger data type to smaller data type  
widening :: assigning a smaller data type to larger data type
