What is java ?  
Java is a programming language. Initially it was owned by Sun Microsystems and now maintained by oracle. Latest version of java is java19

Where is java used?

Mobile devices - android
desktop / standalone application - ms office, windows media player, photoshop
Web based application - automation test store etc
Gaming related application 
Database related applications  - 

Why java ?

It can run on multiple platforms like windows, mac, linux, redhat etc…
Simple and easy to understand and learn
It is an open source and freeware
It is secure and fast
There is a lot of community support
It is object oriented


public class MyFirstJavaProgram {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
System.out.println("hello amit   welcome to java series");
	}

}




GIT - Version controlling 


Green 
Red
Yellow
Green

Using git we will be able to maintain multiple versions of a particular software very easily
In a realtime environment with git it is easy to share the project changes in files among all the team members.


Remote repo : git hub
Local repo : laptop


Git add . : it will move all the changes from local repo to staging area
Git commit -m “commit message” : it will commit all the changes moved to staging area
Git push : it will move the changes from local repo to remote repo
Git pull : it will move the changes from  remote repo to  local repo 


Java Variable.
variables are used for storing the data either temporarily or permanantly. 

x=10;
x=20;

String : stores text
note : every string value in java should be enclosed with in " " 
int : it will store whole numbers
float : it will store decimal values
char : it will store a single character
boolean : either true or false


syntax for writing variables

<data type> <variable name> = <value>;

note :  in java every statement should end with a semicolon";"


when we want to assign a value to a variable permanantly the that variable has to be declared as final.



Java Identifiers:
==================
java identifiers are nothing but the variable names.
each variable name in java must be unique.

some additional rules for java identifiers
1)identifiers names should only contain letters, digits,underscore and dollar sign only
2)identifiers name should begin with a letter
3) Spaces are not allowed
4)there are 53 reserved words in java, these reserved words cannot be used as identifiers



Java Data Types
===============

data type in java will specify the type of data a variable stores/holds

in java there are 8 primitive data types

whole numbers :

byte  : 1 byte - -127 to 126
short : 2 bytes
int : 4 bytes
long : 8 bytes 

decimals :


float : 4 bytes
double : 8 bytes

single alphabets ::

char


true or false :: 

boolean



non primitive data types ::

String is a non primitive data type 




Type Casting :  
=============


type casting is assigning a value of one data type to another

there are two types of type casting

narrowing ::  assigning a larger data type to smaller data type  
widening :: assigning a smaller data type to larger data type  



operators : operators in java are used to perform oprations in java code
there are multiple types of java operators

1) Arithmatic operators :

Additon :   +
substraction : -
multiplication : *
division : / (quotient)
mudulos : % (reminder)
increment : ++
note : there are two types of increment operators - 
pre increment  : the values of variable is first incremented and use later(int variable1 =10; ++variable1;)
and 
post increment : the values of variable are first used and incremented later(int variable1 =10; variable1++;)


decrement : --

int z = x+y;
operator : +
operands : x,y,z;



2) Assignment operators : these operators are used to assign values to variables

= : normal assignment operator int x =23;
+= : incremental assignment operator x += 23;  // x = x+23;  // 46
-= : decremental assignment operator x -= 23  // x = x-23; // 23
*= : multiplicative assignment operator x *= 2 // x = x*2  // 46
/= : division assignment operator x /= 2 // x = x/2 ; 23
%= : mudulos assignment operator x %= 10 // x = x%10 ; // 3



3) Comparision operators : these are used to compare the values in between two variables

note : the result of comparision operation is always boolean(either true or false)


 == : this will check if the values of both the variables is equal or not // int x = 1,y=2; x == y; // false
 != : not equals to operator  // int x = 1,y=2; x != y;  // true
 > : greater than operator
 < : less than operator
 >= : greater than or equals to operator
 <=  : less than or equals to operator
 
 
 4) Logical Operators : these are used for performing logical operations in java programming
 
 note : the operands for logical operations should be boolean
 
 logical AND :  && : when both the values are true then the result is true else it will false
 logical OR :  ||  : if atlease one value is true then result is true
 logical NOT : !   : it will reverse the result.
